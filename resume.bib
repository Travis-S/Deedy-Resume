abstract = {Quantum characterization, validation, and verification (QCVV) techniques are used to probe, characterize, diagnose, and detect errors in quantum information processors (QIPs). An important component of any QCVV protocol is a mapping from experimental data to an estimate of a property of a QIP. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can help automate the development of QCVV protocols, creating such maps by learning them from training data. We identify the critical components of "machine-learned" QCVV techniques, and present a rubric for developing them. To demonstrate this approach, we focus on the problem of determining whether noise affecting a single qubit is coherent or stochastic (incoherent) using the data sets originally proposed for gate set tomography. We leverage known ML algorithms to train a classifier distinguishing these two kinds of noise. The accuracy of the classifier depends on how well it can approximate the "natural" geometry of the training data. We find GST data sets generated by a noisy qubit can reliably be separated by linear surfaces, although feature engineering can be necessary. We also show the classifier learned by a support vector machine (SVM) is robust under finite-sample noise.},

abstract = {Quantum state tomography on a d-dimensional system demands resources that grow rapidly with d. They may be reduced by using model selection to tailor the number of parameters in the model (i.e., the size of the density matrix). Most model selection methods typically rely on a test statistic and a null theory that describes its behavior when two models are equally good. Here, we consider the loglikelihood ratio. Because of the positivity constraint {\$}\backslashrho \backslashgeq 0{\$}, quantum state space does not generally satisfy local asymptotic normality, meaning the classical null theory for the loglikelihood ratio (the Wilks theorem) should not be used. Thus, understanding and quantifying how positivity affects the null behavior of this test statistic is necessary for its use in model selection for state tomography. We define a new generalization of local asymptotic normality, metric-projected local asymptotic normality, show that quantum state space satisfies it, and derive a replacement for the Wilks theorem. In addition to enabling reliable model selection, our results shed more light on the qualitative effects of the positivity constraint on state tomography.},
